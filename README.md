# kafka-eks-argocd-stack
# Event-Driven K8s Platform üöÄ

A real-world, cloud-native project that combines Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Kubernetes, Kafka, and Prometheus to build a scalable, event-driven microservices architecture ‚Äî perfect for preparing for principal engineer interviews or demonstrating DevOps mastery.

## üß† Project Goal

Build a fault-tolerant, observable, production-grade platform that:
- Ingests patient update events in real-time
- Streams them through Apache Kafka
- Deploys producer/consumer microservices on Kubernetes (EKS)
- Monitors system health with Prometheus + Grafana
- Uses GitOps CI/CD with GitHub Actions + ArgoCD
- Provisions infra with Terraform and configures Kafka via Ansible (with dynamic EC2 inventory)
